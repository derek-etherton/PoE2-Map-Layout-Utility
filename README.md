## üöÄ **Running the Application**

### üéØ **Overlay Mode** (`PoE_Campaign_Layouts.exe`)
- Borderless overlay that sits on top of Path of Exile 2
- Perfect for single monitor setups
- System tray integration - right-click the tray icon to access settings
- Minimal interference with gameplay

### ü™ü **Windowed Mode** (`PoE_Campaign_Layouts_Windowed.exe`)
- Standalone window application
- Great for dual monitor setups or if you prefer a separate window
- Responsive UI that scales with window size
- Settings accessible directly in the main window

## ‚öôÔ∏è **First-Time Setup**

**When you first run the app, you'll need to configure a few basic settings:**

### 1. **Set Your PoE2 Log File Path**
   - Click the "Browse" button
   - Navigate to your PoE2 log file (usually at one of these locations):
     - `D:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\logs\Client.txt`
     - `Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2\Logs\Client.txt`
   - The app will try to find it automatically, but you can browse if needed

### 2. **Choose Your Weapon Type** (optional but recommended)
   - Select from: Bow, Crossbow, Quarter Staff, Spear, One Hand Mace, Two Hand Mace
   - This lets the app show you the best weapons for your character level

### 3. **Set Your Character Level** (optional)
   - Enter your current level
   - The app will auto-detect when you level up from the game logs

### 4. **Save Settings**
   - Click "Save Settings" to save your configuration
   - Settings are remembered for next time!

### **Accessing Settings Later:**
- **Overlay Mode**: Right-click the system tray icon ‚Üí Settings
- **Windowed Mode**: Click to expand the "Settings" section in the main window

### **Advanced Settings**

#### **Regex Filter**
- Custom search pattern for in-game item filtering
- Default: `"increased rar"|move` 
- Uses regex syntax - pipe `|` means OR
- Copy these patterns to your in-game item filter

#### **Level Override**
- Check "Override player level" to manually set your level
- Useful if the app can't detect your level automatically
- Leave unchecked for automatic level detection

## üéØ How It Works

### Zone Detection
The application monitors `Client.txt` in your PoE2 logs directory, watching for lines like:
```
[SCENE] Set Source [ZoneName]
```

### Level Detection  
Searches for level-up messages in the format:
```
: PlayerName (ClassName) is now level X
```

### Flask & Weapon Data
- Flask and weapon information stored in JSON files (`public/data/`)
- Automatically finds best items based on level requirements
- Updates display when character levels up

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Maps not showing?**
- Verify your maps folder structure matches zone names
- Check that image files are PNG/JPG format
- Ensure zone detection is working (check console output)

**Level not detecting?**
- Make sure PoE2 is writing to the correct log file location
- Try manually setting level in Settings if auto-detection fails
- Restart the app after changing log file paths

**Flask images not loading?**
- Check that `images/flasks/` directory contains the referenced images
- Fallback colored rectangles will show if images are missing

**Window positioning issues?**
- Use the resize grips in bottom-right corner
- Drag anywhere on the window to reposition
- Settings are remembered between sessions

### **PoE2 Log File Locations**
- **Default**: `D:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\logs\Client.txt`
- **Steam**: Usually the same location
- **Documents**: `Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2\Logs\Client.txt`

## ü§ù **Contributing & Development**

### **For Contributors & Developers**

Want to contribute or run from source? Here's the full development setup:

#### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7+
- Path of Exile 2 installed

#### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/derek-etherton/PoE2-Map-Layout-Utility.git
   cd PoE2-Map-Layout-Utility
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your maps directory**
   - Create a `maps/` folder in the project root
   - Organize by acts: `maps/Act1/`, `maps/Act2/`, etc.
   - Place zone folders inside: `maps/Act1/1_Clearfell/`, `maps/Act1/2_Mud_Burrow/`
   - Add map images (PNG/JPG) to each zone folder

#### **Running from Source**

- **Overlay Mode**: `python poe_campaign_layouts.py`
- **Windowed Mode**: `python poe_campaign_layouts_windowed.py`

#### **Building Executables**

Use the provided build scripts:

```bash
# Windows Batch
build.bat

# PowerShell (recommended)
.\build.ps1
```

Both scripts will:
- Check and install PyInstaller if needed
- Clean previous builds
- Build both overlay and windowed mode executables
- Display file sizes and completion status
